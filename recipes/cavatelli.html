        <h4>Cavatelli for some happy bellies!</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds ricotta cavatelli</li>

        <li>1 pound broccoli rabe, chopped</li>

        </li>1 tablespoon butter</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

        <li>1 pound Italian sausage, removing from casings and cut into bite-size pieces</li>

        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>

        <li>10 ounces roasted red peppers, cut into 1-inch strips</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon chopped garlic</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons concentrated chicken stock (such as Knorr®)</li>

        <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>

        <li>½ cup water</li>

        <li>1 ½ teaspoons cornstarch</li>

        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

    </ul>

    <ol>

        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook cavatelli in the boiling water, stirring
        occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 11 minutes. Drain.</li>

        <li> Fill the same pot with salted water and bring to a boil. 
        Add broccoli rabe; cook until tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain.</l>

        <li>Heat butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
        Add sausage and onion; cook and stir until sausage is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in broccoli rabe, roasted 
        red peppers, and garlic. Cook until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.</l>

        <li>Dissolve chicken stock with white wine and water in a small bowl. Whisk in cornstarch. Pour chicken stock mixture into the skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Bring sauce to a 
        simmer until slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</l>

        <li>Pour sauce over cooked cavatelli and top with 
        Parmesan cheese. Toss lightly and serve.</l>

    </ol>
